        At work or at home, a big part of our everyday lives is spent sweating the small stuff. Keeping our environments safe and clean, putting things where they need to go or making sure the people we care about get a helping hand whenever they need one. Taking on the kind of tasks that are repetitive at best, or drudgerous at worst.

        Imagine a world where time-consuming, everyday tasks are simply taken care of. A world where we can choose to spend our time on the things that really matter. Where our work lives are more productive, and our personal lives are richer for it.

                Where solving many of life’s smallest problems will also help us address some of the world’s most profound ones. From the personal, like the support we might each need as we grow older, to the global, as an ever-aging population changes the future of work for everyone.

                But to get there, we first need to take on the hardest problem in robotics — building robots that can learn how to help us with just about anything.

        <div class="left">Today’s robots are really good at three things — strength, precision, and repetition. But they are really bad at other things — understanding new spaces and environments, and doing more than just one thing. Put simply, their very narrow capabilities come from the human who has programmed them to solve just a single problem, in just one environment.

            To bridge the gap between today’s single-purpose robots and tomorrow’s helper robots, we’re building robots that live in our world, and can learn by themselves. A multifaceted challenge that’s even harder than building a self-driving car because there are no rules of the road for robotics. <br> <br>

We’re starting in the places where we spend most of our waking hours — the places where we work. But we’re not stopping there. We believe helper robots have the potential to ultimately help everyone, everywhere. From offices, to institutions of care, to eventually in our homes, they’ll make our lives easier by lending us a helping hand (or three).
