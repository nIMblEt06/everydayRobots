        At work or at home, a big part of our everyday lives is spent sweating the small stuff. Keeping our environments safe and clean, putting things where they need to go or making sure the people we care about get a helping hand whenever they need one. Taking on the kind of tasks that are repetitive at best, or drudgerous at worst.
       </div>
       <div class="secondC">
        Imagine a world where time-consuming, everyday tasks are simply taken care of. A world where we can choose to spend our time on the things that really matter. Where our work lives are more productive, and our personal lives are richer for it.

                Where solving many of life’s smallest problems will also help us address some of the world’s most profound ones. From the personal, like the support we might each need as we grow older, to the global, as an ever-aging population changes the future of work for everyone.

                Our vision is to build robots that will be as transformative to the physical world, as our computers are in the digital world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But to get there, we first need to take on the hardest problem in robotics — building robots that can learn how to help us with just about anything.
